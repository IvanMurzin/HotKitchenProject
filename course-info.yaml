summary: Your friend has decided to open a new restaurant and you have agreed to help
  him. Since the friend wants everything to be automated, and his customers have access
  to the restaurant through different applications, you have to write a RESTful API
  for his restaurant. In this project, you'll create your own API that will help you
  interact properly with your friend's restaurant.
